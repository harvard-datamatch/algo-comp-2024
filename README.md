# Algo Team Comp 2024

Welcome to Datamatch! This repository will hold the two general comp assignments for the Algo team:

- Creating a lightweight scoring function
- Creating a lightweight stable matching function

This will also include general documentation for things such as Python, Git, and other concepts (e.g. Big-O notation, the stable marriage problem, etc.).
